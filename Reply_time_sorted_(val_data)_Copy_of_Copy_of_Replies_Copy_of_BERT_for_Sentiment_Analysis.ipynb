[SEP] @LozzaCopland \\n\\nDefine \"few\" [SEP] @LozzaCopland I look forward to you jumping to the defence of Christianity when the next child abuse case is aired [SEP] @LozzaCopland love the first 4 words in your bio 🙈🙉🙊 [SEP] @LozzaCopland Actually I have, I condemn Islam and I also condemn you, for talking total crap #LeftistLuzer #sydneysiege [SEP] .@lozzacopland Such wise bull Shit. My cat said as much. This is a real world oh wise one. Nazis were only doing jobs given them. History! [SEP] @LozzaCopland We can condemn an ideology on the basis of the merits &amp; consequences of its ideas. Islam, like all religions, is an ideology. [SEP] @LozzaCopland Only very few people can maintain the perspective that you have in this hour of crisis. [SEP] @LozzaCopland said the well meaning naif. http://t.co/VWONoSuegw [SEP] @LozzaCopland Godwin - so quit condemining all Nazis /Godwin.  Islam is an IDEOLOGY, and therefore has direct influence on behavior. [SEP] @LozzaCopland may not be the majority..but wow, there is sure a lot of them, aren\\'t there ? [SEP] @LozzaCopland How odd its not an athiest holding hostages? I condemn all religious nuts for as long as they cause pain and suffering... [SEP] @LozzaCopland How many times are we going to have the \"Don\\'t judge Islam by this act of terrorism\" conversation? #sydneysiege [SEP] @LozzaCopland @mermayden you can blame their ideology. [SEP] @LozzaCopland True [SEP] @rogerlsimon 1.6 billion muslims worldwide, thats a little over a fifth of the world\\'s population, I think the word \"a few\" is appropriate [SEP] @gibosity Are you saying you condemn all Christians due to those horrible events? Shall we ban crosses, priest robes &amp; large church groups? [SEP] @LozzaCopland quite the opposite. I\\'m saying that churches/Christianty in general are frequently slandered due to the actions of a few. Look [SEP] @LozzaCopland at the response to child sex abuse cases, and ppl slamming Hillsong etc. A full throated defence for these is not often..... [SEP] @LozzaCopland .....forthcoming from ppl when all Christians are branded as pedophiles or \"just after your money\" etc. But apparently in.... [SEP] @LozzaCopland ....future that will change? [SEP] @gibosity I don\\'t think it helps when news is focused primarily on negative/fear inducing. People like to blame region not the individuals. [SEP] @LozzaCopland media is definitely to blame. But the reaction to this, compared to when an individual Christian makes the church look bad.... [SEP] @LozzaCopland ...is VASTLY different [SEP] @gibosity I agree there is a huge difference but I think it\\'s due to a lack of understanding/frequent media reports/mass hysteria &amp; fear')\n",

        "By adding a simple one-hidden-layer neural network classifier on top of BERT and fine-tuning BERT, we can achieve near state-of-the-art performance, which is 10 points better than the baseline method although we only have 3,400 data points.\n",

That result can be achieved because BERT was trained on the huge amount and already encode a lot of information about our language. An impresive performance achieved in a short amount of time, with a small amount of data has shown why BERT is one of the most powerful NLP models available at the moment. "
