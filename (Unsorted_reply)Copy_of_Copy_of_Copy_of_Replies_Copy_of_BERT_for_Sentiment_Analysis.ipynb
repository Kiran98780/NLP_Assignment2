It is this religion og Islam that creates Zombies. [SEP] @LozzaCopland Only very few people can maintain the perspective that you have in this hour of crisis. [SEP] @LozzaCopland .....forthcoming from ppl when all Christians are branded as pedophiles or \"just after your money\" etc. But apparently in.... [SEP] @LozzaCopland at the response to child sex abuse cases, and ppl slamming Hillsong etc. A full throated defence for these is not often..... [SEP] @LozzaCopland How odd its not an athiest holding hostages? I condemn all religious nuts for as long as they cause pain and suffering... [SEP] @LozzaCopland love the first 4 words in your bio 🙈🙉🙊 [SEP] .@lozzacopland Such wise bull Shit. My cat said as much. This is a real world oh wise one. Nazis were only doing jobs given them.

Al Qaeda, al Nusra, ISIS, Iranian Ayatollahs, Boko Haram ... there are many more... [SEP] @LozzaCopland @mermayden you can blame their ideology. [SEP] @LozzaCopland quite the opposite. I\\'m saying that churches/Christianty in general are frequently slandered due to the actions of a few. Look [SEP] @LozzaCopland ....future that will change? [SEP] @gibosity Are you saying you condemn all Christians due to those horrible events? Shall we ban crosses, priest robes &amp; large church groups? [SEP] @LozzaCopland ...is VASTLY different [SEP] @LozzaCopland This is so right. People need to realize it\\'s not a whole. It\\'s a few. [SEP] @LozzaCopland We can condemn an ideology on the basis of the merits &amp; consequences of its ideas. Islam, like all religions, is an ideology. [SEP] @LozzaCopland I look forward to you jumping to the defence of Christianity when the next child abuse case is aired [SEP] @rogerlsimon 1.6 billion muslims worldwide, thats a little over a fifth of the world\\'s population, I think the word \"a few\" is appropriate [SEP] What if the entire race and religion has a majority of radicals that the minority don\\'t have the balls to condemn? #Islam @LozzaCopland [SEP] @LozzaCopland media is definitely to blame. But the reaction to this, compared to when an individual Christian makes the church look bad.... [SEP] @LozzaCopland said the well meaning naif. http://t.co/VWONoSuegw [SEP] @LozzaCopland Godwin - so quit condemining all Nazis /Godwin.  Islam is an IDEOLOGY, and therefore has direct influence on behavior. [SEP] @LozzaCopland True [SEP] @LozzaCopland may not be the majority..but wow, there is sure a lot of them, aren\\'t there ? [SEP] @gibosity I don\\'t think it helps when news is focused primarily on negative/fear inducing. People like to blame region not the individuals.
